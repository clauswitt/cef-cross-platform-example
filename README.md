A simple example of setting up CMake for cross-platform CEF project building.

Building
--------

1. Download the latest Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) for relevant platform(s)
from http://cefbuilds.com/, and extract to "cef/[os]/[arch]" (e.g. cef/win/i386).

2. cd to the build directory

3. run `cmake ..`

4. run `make` / open Visual Studio solution and compile / etc.
